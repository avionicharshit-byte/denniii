Eclipse needs installed plugin "Arduino Eclipse IDE Sloeber V4" or you can use the standalone version Sloeber (min. V4.4.1 needed).

The COM port has to be adapted to the one from your connected board:
Project -> Properties -> Sloeber -> Port

Every other settings are pre-setted and the upload should work immediately, but
you need to re-compile everything before starting upload.
